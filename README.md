# Producer Consumer Lab

For this lab you will implement a trivial producer-consumer system using
python threads where all coordination is managed by counting and binary
semaphores for a system of two producers and two consumers. The producers and
consumers will form a simple rendering pipeline using multiple threads. One
thread will read frames from a file, a second thread will take those frames
and convert them to grayscale, and the third thread will display those
frames. The threads will run concurrently.

## File List
### ExtractFrames.py
Extracts a series of frames from the video contained in 'clip.mp4' and saves 
them as jpeg images in sequentially numbered files with the pattern
'frame_xxxx.jpg'.

### ConvertToGrayscale.py
Loads a series for frams from sequentially numbered files with the pattern
'frame_xxxx.jpg', converts the grames to grayscale, and saves them as jpeg
images with the file names 'grayscale_xxxx.jpg'

### DisplayFrames.py
Loads a series of frames sequently from files with the names
'grayscale_xxxx.jpg' and displays them with a 42ms delay.

### ExtractAndDisplay.py
Loads a series of framss from a video contained in 'clip.mp4' and displays 
them with a 42ms delay

### ecd.py
* Extract frames from a video file, convert them to grayscale, and display
them in sequence by using concurrent threads at 24fps with semaphores
